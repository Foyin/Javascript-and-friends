    Year of enrolment - 2013 
    </p>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>To gain real world knowledge and     experience in the field of computer     science and software engineering.</li>
    <li>To be exposed to new and            innovative ways to implement            programming concepts into different     areas of study.</li>
    <li>To generally become a better        student and computer scientist.</li>
    </ul>
        <p>I am a computer science              student at Carleton University          at the     beginning of my 2nd          year. I am looking for a full           -time summer or part-time summer         internship job  which is related         to my major. I gained admission         into university in 2013, and            then i was in the Information           technology department, but i            later found out that i was more         interested in problem solving           and turning concepts into               reality with code. Generally            concepts in computer science            resonated more strongly with me.         Currently i can produce well            readable and efficient code in C         ++, C, Javascript, Java and             processing (built on java, more         graphically inclined and created         more for artists and designers),         also i am well versed in various         concepts of object-oriented             programming, fundamentals of web         applications, introductory              systems programming, abstract           datatypes and algorithms,  and          because a big part of this              internship to me is the learning         process so i am very open to new         ideas and support. Also from            September 2014 to April 6th 2015         , i took a french course  that          puts me at the B1 Level of the          Common European framework of            reference for Languages for oral         expression and comprehension and         between the A2 â€“B1 levels for           reading and writing and finished         with a B+. I am not a perfect           french speaker yet currently but         am capable of holding simple            conversations and i plan on             continuing to study the language         . I have also taken some                introductory physics courses.
